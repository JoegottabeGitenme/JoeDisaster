High-Level Project Task List (Initiatives)
1. Customer/Market Validation
Conduct discovery interviews with 10–20 target customers (SMBs, edge users, IT leads)
Validate key assumptions: willingness to self-host, cloud usage costs, DR needs
Identify top customer personas and industry verticals
Define minimum viable failover scenario (MVP use case)

2. Architecture & Technical Planning
Design core system architecture: local agent ↔ orchestrator ↔ cloud infra
Define data flow, state sync model, and failure detection mechanism
Decide on supported deployment targets (AWS? others? own infra?)
Select core tech stack (languages, frameworks, platforms)

3. Local Agent Development
Build lightweight agent to run on customer hardware (Go/Node)
Implement app lifecycle hooks (start, stop, redeploy)
Add heartbeat + health check reporting to control plane
Add data sync capability (e.g., restic, rsync, MinIO)

4. Cloud Orchestration & Failover System
Build control plane API for agent communication
Set up failover trigger logic (e.g., TTL expiration → redeploy)
Integrate with CI/CD for automated cloud redeployment
Manage failback detection + redeploy to local

5. CI/CD & GitOps Infrastructure
Implement GitOps model using ArgoCD or Flux
Automate app build and deploy pipelines (Docker + Helm)
Store and version infrastructure templates (Terraform or Pulumi)
Set up container registry and image versioning

6. Cloud Hosting Environment
Deploy scalable, multi-tenant Kubernetes or container-based infra
Integrate dynamic DNS control (Cloudflare, Route53)
Set up monitoring, alerting, and logging (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki)
Implement billing hooks (cloud usage metering, runtime costs)

7. Security & Compliance
Implement TLS/mTLS across all communication channels
Integrate secrets management (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
Encrypt all synced data at rest and in transit
Plan compliance roadmap (SOC2 readiness, GDPR if applicable)

8. Monitoring & Observability
Build unified monitoring dashboard (for internal + client use)
Collect metrics from local agents and cloud infra
Implement alert system for failovers, errors, sync issues

9. Customer Dashboard & Self-Service Portal
Build basic web app (React, Vue) to:
Register/monitor local agents
View app status (local/cloud)
Trigger manual failover/test
Add login/authentication, role-based access

10. Pricing & Billing Integration
Define pricing tiers, free trial limitations
Integrate payment processor (Stripe or Paddle)
Track resource usage (e.g., failover time, storage) for billing

11. Sales, Marketing & Launch
Develop marketing site + value prop messaging
Prepare sales materials: pitch deck, one-pager, demo video
Launch early access beta program
Collect testimonials and iterate pricing/models

12. Demo & Proof of Concept
Build hardware demo setup (e.g., Raspberry Pi or Intel NUC)
Deploy app locally, trigger failover live to cloud
Repatriate app after simulated recovery
Use this for demos, sales, and investor conversations

13. Go-To-Market & Support Readiness
Build onboarding flow and documentation
Prepare customer success + technical support workflows
Set up issue reporting and knowledge base
Define SLAs and incident response playbooks
